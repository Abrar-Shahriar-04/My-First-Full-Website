                    <p>The word, Chifuyu means “thousand” and Matsuno means “pine tree”. 

                        Chifuyu Matsuno is the vice-captain of the Tokyo Manji Gang’s First Division. Throughout the series, Chifuyu has been there for his gang members. All of the gang members think highly of Chifuyu which proves that he’s a significant individual. He’s a self-sufficient person who doesn’t like relying on others, instead, he likes helping others. 
                        
                        He made his first appearance on the ground of the broken-down arcade surrounded by the members of Valhalla. Chifuyu gets beaten up very badly by Keisuke Baji to prove his loyalty to Valhalla. Throughout the interaction of Takemichi with Valhalla, Chifuyu remains unconscious. </p>

                        Hōtarō Oreki doesn't like to do things that he considers a waste of energy. However, things start to change when he enters high school because even though he does not want to join any non-compulsory school activities, his older sister requested that he join the memberless Classic Literature Club so that it won't get abolished. Unbeknownst to him, another student, Eru Chitanda, already planned to join; but instead of being free from club obligations, Hōtarō eventually joined as he is strangely unable to refuse or escape from Eru's passionate gaze of curiosity. Together with his friends Satoshi and Mayaka, they began to discuss a variety of mysteries in school that only Hōtarō seems to be able to solve, including the mystery that lingered on from Eru's childhood memory.

                    <h1>The Detective Is Already Dead??!</h1>
                    <p>
                        Kimizuka Kimihiko is a crisis-magnet. From getting caught up in a crime scene to accidentally witnessing a drug deal, trouble seems to find him around every corner. So it is no surprise when his rather mundane flight suddenly enters a state of emergency with a dire need of a detective onboard. Unfortunately, his attempt at avoiding trouble is foiled by a beautiful girl with silver hair who goes by the codename Siesta. Declaring herself a detective, she unceremoniously drags Kimizuka into the case as her assistant. That incident spelled the beginning of an adventure around the globe that went beyond his wildest imagination. Putting their lives on the line, the two took down criminal organizations, prevented disasters, and saved thousands. But the curtain closed to their epic journey with Siesta's untimely death three years later. Resolving to live an ordinary high school life this time, Kimizuka spends a year maintaining a low profile. However, as fate would have it, a girl with an uncanny resemblance to Siesta comes crashing into his life, threatening to throw his peaceful days into disarray.
